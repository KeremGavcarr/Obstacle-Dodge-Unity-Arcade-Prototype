## 🧩 Overview
**Obstacle Dodge** is a fast-paced arcade-style game built in Unity to explore core gameplay programming concepts.  
The player controls a character that must dodge incoming hazards for as long as possible to achieve the highest score.

The project focuses on building a simple but complete game loop using clean code, modular design, and Unity’s component-based workflow.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 Unity Fundamentals
- Understanding the game loop (`Start()` & `Update()`)  
- Building modular gameplay with **Prefabs**  
- Using **Tags** and **Layers** for collision logic  
- Managing components via `GetComponent<>()`  
- Implementing **Cinemachine** for smooth camera motion  
- Handling **collisions**, object destruction, and physics  
- Organizing assets, scenes, and scripts effectively  

### 🔹 C# Programming Concepts
- Declaring variables and using `SerializeField` for Inspector control  
- Structuring reusable and readable methods  
- Applying **conditional statements** for game logic  
- Implementing **frame-rate–independent movement** using `Time.deltaTime`  
- Event-driven gameplay using `OnCollisionEnter()`

## 🕹️ Gameplay Summary
The player moves horizontally to avoid hazards that fly toward them.  
Each second survived increases the score — testing reflexes and reaction time.  
When hit, the game resets instantly for another try.

## 🧩 Features
- 🎯 Smooth, responsive controls  
- 💥 Collision-based gameplay logic  
- 🎥 Cinemachine camera follow  
- 🧱 Prefab-based obstacle system  
- 🧮 Score tracking and game reset flow  
- ⚡ Frame-rate independent mechanics

## 🎓 Learning Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of Unity’s **component-based design philosophy**.  
It helped me develop habits for writing **clean, maintainable, and modular code** — while creating a fully playable, polished mini-game from scratch.
